<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {skyphone} is to create an audio version of a [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) in R.

Skyline is a novelty webservice from GitHub. You input a username and can 'view a 3D model of your GitHub contribution graph.' It looks a bit like a city skyline, hence the name. 

{skyphone} is an exploratory package that fetches the contributions data from the Skyline API and puts it in a nice, tidy table that you can sonify (i.e. convert to an audio signal) or plot. You can [read more in a  blog post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/02/21/skyphone/).

_Note: The [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) API---on which {skyphone} depends---stopped responding (i.e. it 404s) soon after the package was created. I may fix {skyphone} in future [to work via {gh} instead](https://gh.r-lib.org/); feel free to contribute._

## Installation

You can install the {skyphone} package from GitHub:

```{r, install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/skyphone")
```

This assumes you've already installed {remotes} from CRAN with `install.packages("remotes")`

## Examples

The `sky_get()` function fetches from the Skyline API a named user's (open) contributions for a given year. Here's what it looks like to fetch my own contributions for 2020:

```{r example-fetch}
library(skyphone)
md <- sky_get("matt-dray", 2020)
md
```
```
#> # A tibble: 366 x 6
#>    user       year  week   day date       count
#>    <chr>     <int> <int> <int> <date>     <int>
#>  1 matt-dray  2020     1     1 2020-01-01     5
#>  2 matt-dray  2020     1     2 2020-01-02     5
#>  3 matt-dray  2020     1     3 2020-01-03     8
#>  4 matt-dray  2020     1     4 2020-01-04     3
#>  5 matt-dray  2020     2     5 2020-01-05     0
#>  6 matt-dray  2020     2     6 2020-01-06     7
#>  7 matt-dray  2020     2     7 2020-01-07    10
#>  8 matt-dray  2020     2     8 2020-01-08     2
#>  9 matt-dray  2020     2     9 2020-01-09     6
#> 10 matt-dray  2020     2    10 2020-01-10     0
#> # … with 356 more rows
```

You can hear contributions over time by passing the output from `sky_get()` to `sky_sonify()`. This function uses the {sonify} package to convert the data to audio format, where peaks are higher pitched.

```{r example-sonify}
sky_sonify(md, play = FALSE, out_dir = NULL)
```
```
#> 
#> WaveMC Object
#>  Number of Samples:      220500
#>  Duration (seconds):     5
#>  Samplingrate (Hertz):   44100
#>  Number of channels:     2
#>  PCM (integer format):   TRUE
#>  Bit (8/16/24/32/64):    16
```

You'll hear the output from your speakers if you set `play = TRUE` and/or save the audio file as a .wav to the folder provided by `out_dir`.

[`r emo::ji("speaker")` Click here to listen to the sonified output from this example.](https://www.rostrum.blog/output/skyphone/skyphone_matt-dray_2020.wav)

I've also included a simple, opinionated plotting function called `sky_plot`, which gives you a 2D representation of your 'skyline'.

```{r example-plot, fig.alt="A bar chart of contributions to GitHub in 2020 by user matt-dray, which peaks in the summer months."}
p <- sky_plot(md)
p
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/master/static/post/2021-02-20-skyphone_files/figure-html/plot-1.png" alt="A bar chart of contributions to GitHub in 2020 by user matt-dray, which peaks in the summer months." width="100%"/>
</div>
