<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {skyphone} is to create an audio version of [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) in R.

Skyline is a novelty vanity webservice from GitHub. You input a username and can 'view a 3D model of your GitHub contribution graph.' {skyphone} fetches this data and puts it in a nice, tidy table that you can sonify or plot.

Very much in development.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {skyphone} using {remotes}.

```{r, install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("skyphone")
```

## Examples

I'll read in my own 2020 GitHub contributions from the Skyline API.

```{r example-fetch}
library(skyphone)
md <- sky_get("matt-dray", 2020)
md
```

You can make an audio version via the {sonify} package.

```{r example-sonify}
sky_sonify(md, play = FALSE, out_dir = NULL)
```

You can hear the output if you set `play = TRUE` and/or save the audio file as a .wav to the folder provided by `out_dir`.  Here's what it sounds like:

<html><audio controls><source src="https://www.rostrum.blog/output/skyphone/skyphone_matt-dray_2020.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

There's also a simple, opinionated built-in plotting function.

```{r example-plot}
sky_plot(md)
```
